# 🧠 Learning Prompt Engineering

A comprehensive guide to understanding and mastering the art of communicating with AI models like GPT-5.

## 1. What is Prompt Engineering?

**Prompt Engineering** is the practice of crafting effective inputs (called *prompts*) to guide large language models (LLMs) toward producing desired outputs.  

A prompt is more than just a question — it’s a combination of **context**, **instructions**, and **constraints** that help the model understand your intent.

### 💡 Example

| Type | Prompt |
|------|--------|
| ❌ Basic | “Write about climate change.” |
| ✅ Engineered | “You are a science journalist. Write a 200-word article explaining climate change to high school students, using simple language and one analogy.” |

The engineered prompt produces a more accurate, readable, and targeted response because it sets **role, audience, tone, and length**.

## 2. Core Techniques of Prompt Engineering

### 2.1 🎭 Role Assignment
Assign the model a **persona** or **expert role** to shape its tone, vocabulary, and reasoning style.

**How to Use:**  
Use a clear role statement like:  
> “You are a data scientist analyzing customer churn.”  

**Example:**  
> “You are a Python expert. Explain decorators to a beginner with examples.”

---

### 2.2 🧩 Contextualization
Provide **background details**, constraints, or supporting information. This ensures the model operates within a clear frame of reference.

**How to Use:**  
- Include necessary data, excerpts, or goals.
- Be explicit about what the model should *consider* or *ignore*.

**Example:**  
> “Based on this dataset summary, suggest three marketing strategies for a SaaS product with high customer churn in the first 3 months.”

---

### 2.3 ✍️ Explicit Instructions
Give **structured and specific directions** about format, tone, or style.

**How to Use:**  
Use verbs like *list, explain, summarize, write, compare,* etc.

**Example:**  
> “List 5 pros and 5 cons of remote work in bullet points, each under 15 words.”

---

### 2.4 📘 Few-Shot Prompting
Provide **examples** of desired outputs so the model learns by imitation.

**How to Use:**  
Show 1–3 examples before asking for a new one.

**Example:**  
```
Example 1:
Input: "Python"
Output: "A high-level programming language known for readability."

Example 2:
Input: "JavaScript"
Output: "A scripting language used for web development."

Now do the same for: "Go"
```

---

### 2.5 🔗 Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Encourage the model to **reason step-by-step** before giving the final answer.

**How to Use:**  
Add a reasoning instruction:  
> “Think step by step before answering.”

**Example:**  
> “Explain step by step how you would debug a slow SQL query.”

---

### 2.6 🔁 Iterative Refinement
Refine your prompts based on results.  
After each response, ask:
- Did the model understand my intent?
- Was the output structured correctly?
- How can I clarify or constrain further?

**Example:**  
> Initial: “Summarize this article.”  
> Refined: “Summarize this article in 3 bullet points under 30 words each, using simple English.”

---

### 2.7 🧠 Meta-Prompting
Ask the model to **analyze or improve your prompt** before running it.

**Example:**  
> “Review this prompt and suggest improvements to make it more effective for GPT-5.”

## 3. Evaluation Techniques for AI Responses

When working with AI, evaluating output quality is crucial.

### ✅ Key Evaluation Dimensions

| Criterion | Description | Example Question |
|------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Relevance** | Does the answer directly address the prompt? | “Did it stay on topic?” |
| **Accuracy** | Are the facts correct? | “Does this code actually work?” |
| **Clarity** | Is the response easy to read and understand? | “Would a beginner get this?” |
| **Depth** | Does it show reasoning or insight? | “Does it explain *why*, not just *what*?” |
| **Structure** | Is it well-organized and formatted? | “Are bullet points, headers, or steps used?” |
| **Creativity** | Is the output unique or insightful? | “Does it show originality?” |

### 🧩 Evaluation Tips
- Compare responses from **different prompt versions**.
- Ask the model to **self-evaluate** using rubrics.
- Use **automated scoring** (for coding, grammar, etc.).
- Encourage the model to **justify** its choices.

**Example:**  
> “Rate your previous answer for clarity and accuracy on a scale from 1–10, and explain why.”

## 4. Real-World Examples for Programmers

### Example 1: Debugging Assistance
**Prompt:**
> “You are a senior Python developer. Analyze the following traceback and explain what’s causing the error, then suggest a fix.”

### Example 2: Code Optimization
**Prompt:**
> “Optimize this Python function for readability and performance. Explain your changes step-by-step.”

### Example 3: API Design
**Prompt:**
> “Design a REST API for a library management system. Include endpoints, HTTP methods, and example JSON payloads.”

### Example 4: Code Review
**Prompt:**
> “Review this JavaScript code and identify 3 potential security or performance issues.”

### Example 5: Learning Concept
**Prompt:**
> “Explain multithreading vs multiprocessing in Python with code samples and real-world use cases.”

## 5. Assignments

### 🧭 Beginner Level
1. Write 3 versions of a prompt to generate a summary of a Wikipedia article. Compare the outputs.  
2. Create a role-based prompt for a model acting as a *teacher* explaining recursion.  
3. Evaluate one of your AI responses using the 5 criteria above.

### ⚙️ Intermediate Level
4. Use few-shot prompting to teach the model to generate SQL queries from English questions.  
5. Refine a prompt iteratively to make the model produce clean, commented Python code.  
6. Create a prompt chain that:
   - Generates test cases for a function
   - Then asks the model to explain how it derived them.

### 🚀 Advanced Level
7. Build a **prompt evaluation rubric** (like an AI grading system).  
8. Experiment with **meta-prompting**: ask GPT-5 to improve one of your own prompts.  
9. Create a **prompt template** that transforms user requirements into structured JSON (for app automation).  
10. Document your results and reflections in a Markdown file titled *“My Prompt Engineering Journey.”*
