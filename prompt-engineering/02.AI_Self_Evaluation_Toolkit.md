# 🧠 AI Self-Evaluation & Improvement Toolkit

A reusable collection of **prompt templates** to help AI models evaluate and improve their own responses.

---

## 📘 Overview

Self-evaluation prompting encourages an AI model (like GPT-5) to reflect on its previous output using a structured **rubric** — just like a teacher grading a student.  
This improves accuracy, depth, and clarity over multiple iterations.

## 1. 🧩 Universal Self-Evaluation Template

Use this when you want the AI to assess any type of response (text, code, explanation, etc.).

```markdown
You are an expert evaluator.

Evaluate your previous response based on the following rubric:

**Rubric:**
1. **Accuracy (1–10):** Are all statements correct and verifiable?
2. **Clarity (1–10):** Is the response easy to understand and well-written?
3. **Completeness (1–10):** Does it cover all important aspects of the question?
4. **Relevance (1–10):** Does it directly address the user’s intent?
5. **Structure (1–10):** Is it well-organized and formatted clearly?

After scoring, write a short paragraph explaining:
- What was strong about the response  
- What could be improved  
- How you would improve it if you rewrote it

Then, **revise the original answer** to create a **Version 2 (Improved Response)** based on your evaluation.
```

## 2. 💻 Self-Evaluation Template for Programmers

This version focuses on **code quality, performance, and readability.**

```markdown
You are a senior software engineer performing a code review.

Evaluate your previous code response based on the following rubric:

**Rubric:**
1. **Correctness (1–10):** Does the code logically and functionally work?
2. **Readability (1–10):** Is it easy to understand and well-commented?
3. **Efficiency (1–10):** Are there unnecessary computations or bottlenecks?
4. **Security (1–10):** Could it expose vulnerabilities or unsafe practices?
5. **Scalability (1–10):** Will it handle larger data or use cases?

After scoring, summarize strengths and weaknesses in bullet points, then produce an **improved code version** with explanations of each change.
```

## 3. ✍️ Self-Evaluation Template for Writers

Perfect for blogs, essays, or marketing copy.

```markdown
You are an editorial reviewer evaluating your own writing.

Evaluate the previous response using the following rubric:

**Rubric:**
1. **Clarity (1–10):** Is it easy to follow and understand?
2. **Engagement (1–10):** Does it capture the reader’s attention?
3. **Tone Consistency (1–10):** Is the tone appropriate for the audience?
4. **Structure (1–10):** Are sections and transitions well-organized?
5. **Creativity (1–10):** Does it demonstrate originality or style?

Write a short critique (3–5 sentences) explaining how to improve it.  
Then rewrite the text in a polished, publication-ready form.
```

## 4. 🎓 Self-Evaluation Template for Teaching & Explanations

Best for educational content or conceptual breakdowns.

```markdown
You are a teaching assistant reviewing your own explanation.

Evaluate the previous explanation based on this rubric:

**Rubric:**
1. **Accuracy (1–10):** Are facts and examples correct?
2. **Clarity (1–10):** Is it understandable to a beginner?
3. **Depth (1–10):** Does it explain both *what* and *why*?
4. **Examples (1–10):** Are examples clear and relevant?
5. **Engagement (1–10):** Does it hold attention and encourage curiosity?

After scoring, suggest improvements and rewrite the explanation as if teaching a class of beginners.
```

## 5. 🔁 Reflection + Revision Chain

You can chain evaluation and revision steps for better results:

1. **Step 1:** Generate an initial answer.  
2. **Step 2:** Apply one of the rubrics for self-evaluation.  
3. **Step 3:** Revise the answer based on evaluation feedback.  
4. **Step 4:** (Optional) Re-evaluate the improved version to measure progress.

This process is called **self-reflective prompting** or **feedback looping.**

---

## 💡 Example

**Prompt:** “Explain recursion simply.”

**Step 1 — AI Response:**
> “Recursion is when a function calls itself.”

**Step 2 — Apply Rubric (Universal Template):**
> Accuracy: 8/10 — correct, but incomplete.  
> Clarity: 9/10 — simple, but could use an analogy.  
> Completeness: 6/10 — lacks base condition explanation.  
> Suggested improvement: add an example or metaphor.

**Step 3 — Improved Version:**
> “Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve smaller problems until a base condition stops the loop.  
> Imagine two mirrors facing each other — the reflections keep repeating smaller and smaller versions.”

## ⚙️ Pro Tips

- You can **customize rubrics** for any domain (UX design, legal writing, finance, etc.).  
- Use self-evaluation prompts to **train consistency** in long-running projects.  
- Combine with **chain-of-thought** or **meta-prompting** for best results.  
- Use Markdown formatting for easy readability and saving version history.
